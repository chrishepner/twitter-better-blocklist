# Make Twitter marginally better

We all agree that Twitter is bad, but we can make it slightly better by
removing some of the more hostile UI. This is a filter list
for uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, etc., that removes some of
the content that you never asked for. Get those useless
snippets of "news" and suggestions that you follow cryptofascists
out of your life.

Specifically, this filter list does the following:

- Removes the "Trending" sidebar section
- Removes the "Who to follow" sidebar section
- Removes the "Relevant people" sidebar section
